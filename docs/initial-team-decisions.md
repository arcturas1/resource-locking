# Initial Team Decisions

This document lays out an initial set of decisions made at the beginning of the project to
all get on the same page.

## Communication

Primary communication was decided that we'd talk through [Slack](https://slack.com) in a new team for this project.
We also decided that we'd make more communication, process, discussion changes in slack, as most of the team had very
different schedules and in person communication is pretty hard to achieve.

## Version Control

The main version control tool we decided to use was [git](https://www.git-scm.com), and specifically using the
hosted git service: [github](https://github.com/rooftopsparrow/resource-locking). We would be using the public and free tier
of the platform.

## Project Management

It was proposed to use the built in tools in github like issues and milestones to track project assignments, design discussions, task delegation, and longer async communication. Consensus not reached yet.

## Build Tools

It was proposed to use maven or gradle, or some other build others that the team was comfortable with. Consensus not reached yet.
